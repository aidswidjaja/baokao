Free and open-source web application to view, edit and collaborate on study resources.

## design principles

- as fast as possible
- maintainable
- lightweight
- top-notch user experience
- client over server
- just *works*

## why PHP?
Because I hate high-quality maintainable code that uses the industry-standard MVC model which emphasises best coding practices, plus I'm hoping it uses less than 512 MB of RAM (thx heroku), oh and also I only have two weeks to get this running and I sort of want to finish my playthrough of Fire Emblem (the one with Roy in it). 
## dependencies
Minimal dependencies because the Twig templating engine was too hard to use.
